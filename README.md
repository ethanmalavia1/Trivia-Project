Title: Trivia Game

Goal: Our goal for this project was to create a simple but effective program that prompts the user with questions, and they must answer them in a timely manner. 

Project Description: The quiz game offers users the ability to select a subject from a variety of options. Each subject contains a dictionary of questions, where the key represents the question, and the value is the correct letter answer corresponding to the correct answer in the array of options.

Once a user selects a subject, the new_game function dynamically presents the questions and options to the user. A timer functionality has been integrated into the quiz game to add an additional challenge. Users must answer questions within a specified time limit to test their knowledge under pressure.

After selecting an option, the user's choice is passed to the check_answer function, which validates the answer. Upon completing the quiz, the display_score function is invoked, presenting the user's score. Subsequently, the new_game function prompts the user to decide whether they want to play again.

Improvments: Some things that we can improve is better visual effects if more time was allotted. Could have implemented a difficulty system. We could have implemented more error handling for the questions.

Summary: Overall, our project is a quiz game that dynamically displays questions based on a subject. The program keeps track of correct and wrong answers, and has a timer feature that makes it a timed quiz.
